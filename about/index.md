# About

I'm Andy Bayer, a programmer, musician and writer studying at Northwestern University.

## Experience

#### [__CodeHS__](https://codehs.com/) | _Software Engineering Intern_
I spent two summers at CodeHS working as a full-stack software engineering intern.
Some of the major things I completed were modularizing the site's graphics library, designing and creating autograders for Javascript and Python, and improving developer tools.

#### [__Ketch__]({{site.url}}/projects/ketch) | _Developer_
I was the lead developer and designer for an app created within Northwestern's NUvention program. I've written about my experience working on the app [on this site]({{site.url/projects/ketch}}).

#### [__Atom__](https://atom.io/) | _Contributor_
I've contributed to a few Atom packages, including [`tree-view`](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/793) and [`tabs`](https://github.com/atom/tabs/commits?author=anderoonies).

## Skills
I work mostly in Python and Javascript, with experience in iOS, Coffeescript, and HTML/CSS.
