# About

I studied music performance and computer science at Northwestern University with a focus on systems, programming languages, and security. I do [distance running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/23057637) and play Magic: The Gathering.

## Experience

#### [**CodeHS**](https://codehs.com/) | _Software Engineer_

I do full-stack work at CodeHS. I redesigned our web IDE to be faster, smaller, and more portable, built a reliable, scaling infrastructure for our code servers, and led work on our Python autograders.

## Open Source

### [**CubeCubra**](https://cubecobra.com) | _Contributor_
Regular contributions to software for building and playtesting Magic: The Gathering cubes. Check out my [pauper cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/andyscube)!

#### [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) | _Contributor_
I've contributed to a few Atom packages, including [`tree-view`](https://github.com/atom/tree-view) and [`tabs`](https://github.com/atom/tabs).

## Skills

I've spent years writing Python and JavaScript, with experience in Django, React, and React-Redux. I'm familiar with FP languages like CLISP and Elm.
